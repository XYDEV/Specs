  "summary": "Provides both List & Grid UICollectionViewLayouts AND ability to animate from one layout type to the other.",
  "description": "There are many situations where you want to use a UICollectionView to display a set of data using alternating List and Grid format layouts. The List layout is like a traditional UITableView where each element is presented as a full width row, while the Grid layout displays multiple cell elements per row. The combination of these two layouts allows you to present data or options within a UI in either a verbose (List) or compact (Grid) format. The challenge has been to effectively manage the transition between these UICollectionViewLayouts. That is where CPTGridListManager comes in. This framework provides the necessary Grid & List layouts, Transition layout, and Transition Manager to enable a smooth animation between these two formats. It even provides an animated button that can be used to trigger the layout change. Supplementary views (section headers & footers) are also supported by the animation engine. CPTGridListManager is written in Objective-C and is based on the work of another project, DisplaySwitcher by Yalantis, which was written in Swift.",
